			<h3 style="text-align:center;">VISIONS OF YOUTH</h3>
			<p>Hello and welcome to the inaugural Parallax Film Festival, an independent film festival taking place at The Collection in Lincoln on the 12th and 13th of November 2016!

The festival was created with the help of Lincolnshire One Venues, The British Film Institute and Film Hub Central East and organised by a group of young adults who have a passion for independent films from the UK and around the world!

We are in the process of selecting a handful of well-known independent films to screen at the festival, but the lineup won't be complete without you! We want you to submit your films to screen alongside these established films, so we can showcase and celebrate everything independent filmmaking has to offer.

Parallax Film Festival revolves around one central theme and, in our first year, the theme is youth. Therefore, submitted films should be about, represent or focus on the concept of youth. It can explore how young people interact with each other, how older generations see young people, how we look back on our youth - the possibilities are endless! If your film has anything at all to do with youth, don't hesitate to submit it.

Up for grabs is a bunch of awards, presented exclusively to the best submissions we receive!

If your film is selected or nominated, you will be invited to the festival and receive one of our free weekend passes, giving you access to every screening and exhibition at the festival. Further details of the event will be revealed as we get closer to the date.

Thank you for all of your submissions! </p>
